        Hello, and welcome to my little corner on the internet! I'm a PhD candidate in complex networks at Leiden University <a href="https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/">Computational Network Science Group</a> and guest researcher at University of Amsterdam as part of <a href="www.planetworks.nl">PLANET-NL research group</a>. My research centers around analyzing complex network dynamics in social networks. I aim to use computational methods to identify emergent patterns and group-behaviour in temporal (population-scale) social networks. Additionally, I contribute for open knowledge initiatives and decentralized technologies.

## My Research Focus

My current doctoral research centers on analyzing community dynamics and movement patterns in temporal, population-scale networks. As part of the PLANET-NL research group, I am developing and applying novel computational and analytical methods to understand how emergent patterns and self-organization manifest in these complex systems, using rich datasets from the Netherlands. This work builds upon my Master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), titled "Adaptive containment strategies for epidemics in metapopulation networks," where I explored how subpopulations can adaptively implement travel restrictions during an epidemic.

## Academic Journey

My academic path began at The American University in Cairo (AUC), where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechatronics, where I also did study abroads at Radboud University and Aarhus University. My undergraduate thesis involved the design of a 3 DOF haptic interface device with assistive force feedback. 

Since I enjoyed the numerical and modeling part the most, I pursued a Master of Science in Computational Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). There, I studied simulation, modeling, analysis, and high-performance computing. During my Master's I was also reading a lot about non-linear dynamics and complex systems, which eventually led me down the facinating rabbit-hole that is networks.
