Hello, and welcome to my little corner on the internet! I'm a PhD candidate in complex networks at Leiden University [Computational Network Science Group](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/) and guest researcher at University of Amsterdam as part of [PLANET-NL research group](www.planetworks.nl). My research centers around analyzing complex network dynamics in social networks. I aim to use computational methods to identify emergent patterns and self-organization in temporal (population-scale) networks. Additionally, I contribute for open knowledge initiatives and decentralized technologies.

**My Research Focus**

My current doctoral research centers on analyzing community dynamics and movement patterns in temporal, population-scale networks. As part of the PLANET-NL research group, I am developing and applying novel computational and analytical methods to understand how emergent patterns and self-organization manifest in these complex systems, using rich datasets from the Netherlands. This work builds upon my Master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), titled "Adaptive containment strategies for epidemics in metapopulation networks," where I explored how subpopulations might adaptively implement travel restrictions during an epidemic.

My broader research interests span computational modeling, network science, complex systems, data analysis, and the application of engineering principles to understand dynamic phenomena.

**Academic Journey**

My academic path began at The American University in Cairo (AUC), where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics. My undergraduate thesis, titled"Haptic Feedback Robotic Device for Neuromuscular Rehabilitation,", involved the design of a 3 DOF haptic interface device for assistive and resistive force feedback in upper limb rehabilitation. 

Seeking to deepen my computational and analytical skills, I pursued a Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). This program provided rigorous training in simulation, modeling, analysis, and high-performance computing. During my Master's I also delved into non-linear dynamics and complex systems, which eventually lead me down the facinating rabbit-hole that is network science.

Beyond formal research, I've also engaged in teaching and outreach, serving as a Teaching Assistant for Engineering Dynamics & Machine Design at AUC and developing and instructing an Algorithmic Art Course at the Cocoon Culture Centre. These experiences reinforced my understanding of fundamental principles and my ability to communicate complex ideas.

My academic journey has been enriched by international experiences, including a Summer Study Abroad at Aarhus University, Denmark, and an Erasmus+ Student Exchange at Radboud University, The Netherlands. These opportunities broadened my perspective and exposed me to different academic cultures.

I am driven by the challenge of understanding and modeling the complex world around us, and I am enthusiastic about contributing to interdisciplinary research at the forefront of complexity science.
