# Welcome

I'm **Gamal Adel**, a PhD researcher specializing in complex networks and social dynamics.

My work focuses on analyzing community dynamics and movement patterns in temporal, population-scale networks using computational methods.

## Current Research

As part of the [PLANET-NL research group](http://www.planetworks.nl), I develop novel analytical methods to understand emergent patterns and self-organization in complex systems.

## Recent Work

Check out my [research](/research/) page for publications and ongoing projects.
