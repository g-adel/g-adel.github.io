## My Research
Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in complex networks at Leiden University [Computational Network Science Group](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/) and guest researcher at University of Amsterdam as part of [PLANET-NL research group](www.planetworks.nl). My research centers around analyzing complex network dynamics applied on social networks. I aim to use computational methods to identify emergent patterns and self-organization in temporal (population-scale) networks.


<!-- ## My Research Focus -->

My doctoral research centers on analyzing community dynamics and connectivity patterns in temporal, population-scale networks. As part of the PLANET-NL research group, I develop and applying novel computational and analytical methods to understand how emergent patterns and self-organization manifest in complex systems. This work builds upon my Master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I explored a metapopulation network model of how cities can adaptively implement containment strategies during an epidemic.

<!-- ## Academic Journey -->

My academic path began at The American University in Cairo (AUC), where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechatronics, including study abroads at Radboud University and Aarhus University. My undergraduate thesis involved the design of a 3 DOF haptic interface device with assistive force feedback. I pursued my interest in mathematical modeling and simulation through a Master of Science in Computational Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During my Master's I was also reading a lot about non-linear dynamics and complex systems, which eventually led me down the facinating rabbit-hole that is networks.
