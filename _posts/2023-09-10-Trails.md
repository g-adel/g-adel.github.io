- The objective is to create a particle system that follows a flow field
- This has been done many times over (see [Flow Fields — Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields), [Getting Creative with Perlin Noise Fields · Sighack](https://sighack.com/post/getting-creative-with-perlin-noise-fields)). I myself have experimented with this system a few times already both in Processing and shaders.
