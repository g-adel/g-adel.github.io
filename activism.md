I partake in several initiatives and activities that aim to improve access to information, knowledge, and resources for all, especially those who need it most. In no particular order, some of the groups or initiatives that I somewhat regularly contribute to are:
- [Editor for the Arabic and English Wikipedias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:I.Elgamal)
- [Member of The Turing Way group](https://book.the-turing-way.org/)
- [Member of Open Science Community Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden)
- [Member of Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/network/)
