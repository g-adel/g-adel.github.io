Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in complex networks at Leiden University [Computational Network Science Group](https://www.computationalnetworkscience.org/) and guest researcher at University of Amsterdam as part of [PLANET-NL research group](www.planetworks.nl). My research centers around analyzing complex network dynamics applied on social networks. I aim to use computational methods to identify emergent patterns and self-organization in temporal (population-scale) networks. Additionally, I contribute to open knowledge initiatives and decentralized technologies.
